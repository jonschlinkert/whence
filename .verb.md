## What is this, and why do I need it?

## Use Cases

- Config files
- Key bindings
- HTML templates

## Usage

```js
const whence = require('whence');
```


## Options

### booleanLogicalOperators

Enables boolean behavior for binary logical operators (`&&`, `||`, and `??`), which is functionally equivalent to wrapping expressions with binary logical operators in `Boolean()`.

For example, with this option enabled:

- `0 && 1` would typically return `0`, but instead will be evaluated as `Boolean(0 && 1)`, returing `false`.
- `1 && 2` would typically return `2`, but instead will be evaluated as `Boolean(1 && 2)`, returing `true`.

**Examples**

```js
console.log(1 && 2); //=> 2
console.log('' && 1); //=> ''
console.log(0 && 0); //=> 0

// The following behavior is applied when booleanLogicalOperators is enabled
console.log(Boolean(1 && 2)); //=> true
console.log(Boolean('' && 1)); //=> false
console.log(Boolean(0 && 0)); //=> false
```
